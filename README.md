## Development
The dependencies of this package are managed by [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinyiot/thing-directory.git
cd thing-directory
```

Compile from source:
```bash
go build
```
This will result in an executable named `thing-directory` (linux/macOS) or `thing-directory.exe` (windows).

Get the CLI arguments help (linux/macOS):

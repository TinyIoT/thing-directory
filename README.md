This is a candidate implementation for the W3C [Web of Things (WoT) Thing Directory](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-thing-directory) service, a catalog of [Thing Descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/).

The catalog currently supports XPath 3.0 and JSONPath as query languages.

This is currently under development.

## Getting Started
* [Configuration](https://github.com/linksmart/thing-directory/wiki/Configuration)
* [Query Language](https://github.com/linksmart/thing-directory/wiki/Query-Language)
* [OpenAPI Specification](https://linksmart.eu/swagger-ui/dist/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linksmart/thing-directory/master/apidoc/openapi-spec.yml)

## Installation
### Binary Distribution
1. Download the binary distribution and configuration file from [releases](https://github.com/linksmart/thing-directory/releases)
2. Download the WoT Thing Description JSON Schema document. E.g. [wot_td_schema.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linksmart/thing-directory/master/wot/wot_td_schema.json)
3. Run, e.g. in Linux/AMD64:
```
./thing-directory-linux-amd64 --conf ./thing-directory.json --schema ./wot_td_schema.json
```
For more information about the CLI arguments, set `--help` flag.

### Docker
Run the latest build of Thing Directory with the default configuration file ([/conf/thing-directory.json](https://github.com/linksmart/thing-directory/blob/master/sample_conf/thing-directory.json)):
```
docker run -p 8081:8081 linksmart/td
```
The index of the RESTful API should now be accessible at: http://localhost:8081

The configurations can be changes by mounting a directory and providing the paths in CLI arguments. For more information about the CLI arguments, set `--help` flag.

Please refer to the API Documentation to learn about the different endpoints.
